## State of the Project
This is still in experimental State to evaluate if this makes sense to me and others.

So I try to keep this repo as stable as possible - there are no guarantees for that.

If you want to try it out and you are stuck - please open an issue!

This project is the 2. attempt realising these ideas. Here you find the first attempt: https://github.com/pme123/camundala

## Twitter Example
As a first demo I used the famous Twitter example.
See [here](examples/twitter/README.md)
